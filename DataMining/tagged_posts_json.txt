While the concepts are not terribly applicable to the real world, they are still very interesting and are useful in helping to understand and reinforce the parts of C++ you already recognize. As mentioned by my classmates in this post who are much smarter than I, the class is no slouch in terms of workload and comprehension but it is certainly manageable unlike 445L. As a reference point, I took 445L, EPL, vector cal, and the latter half of senior design last semester and survived (barely).\n\nLong story short, I would recommend taking EPL.

But on the whole it seems apparent that he is there to focus on his research and spend as little energy as possible on teaching.

The workload isn't much though compared to the harder EE classes", "I took it last semester with Barber. The course (as Jon mentioned) is really based around the business aspects of requirements rather than the engineering. She'll try to relate how the business decisions affect engineering decisions and our choices as engineers, though.\n\nI found the strong business focus made engaging in the course difficult because I'm not a business major and don't have any intentions on working the business side of engineering. The course does cover important engineering requirement topics (like technical documents and different representations of how requirements are presented), but it typically follows a specific format her company uses (AWAREness solution, more here: http://www.awaresoftwareinc.com/). Though this isn't bad, it doesn't really teach the overarching idea of requirements (especially in today's dynamic software companies).\n\nThat being said, the course wasn't super difficult and she was pretty lenient with grading and assignments. We had 4 major assignments and a last class day final. The assignments weren't difficult but could be time consuming and take some planning, and one or two were \"group\" assignments. Lecture consisted of her going over slideshows and occasionally drawing things out on the board. Toward the end she started trying to engage the class with participation-based in-course exercises (which I personally found helped me engage in the course a bit more). I don't know if she's decided to use this method more since, but if she did it might help make the course more interesting.\n\nMost of the assignments and material was based on hypothetical situations that were typically NOT software based. You'd get a situation about a business' workflow or course registration and have to come up with some set of requirements based on the scenario. Some of the material could get wishy-washy and have several approaches that were correct based on assumptions or specificity.\n\nOverall, I don't feel I gained a great deal of engineering requirements knowledge from the course, but you'll get the requirements life cycle and at least an understanding of how SOME businesses handle requirements. It's also wasn't a seriously time-consuming course, so if you're willing to put up with a bit of ridiculousness, it can very well serve as padding on an otherwise heavy schedule.", "haha i took it last semester too, so I guess you were in my clas. honestly, it's one of the much easier A's out of the EE classes so if that's what you're looking for, go for it", "That's assuming she hasn't made any serious changes to the curriculum.\n\nIt's a course that's a breeze to get a B/B+, and just a little effort to get a solid A.", "Thanks both of you!", "showed up to class about once a month...got an A."], "related_courses": ["EE361q"], "id": "155621761221818_778135645637090"}, {"message": "Differences between 351M and 362K?

Is there no compromise on learning material without pipelining labs and having prelabs due the day of the test? I realize that there is a lot of material to cover but wouldn't a second class devoted to the topic be better than cramming them all together?", "I honestly don't think so. If you look at the actual labs, they follow in sequence pretty heavily. For example, labs 7, 8, and 11 are all for the final design. And building any of that without many of the previous labs would be quite difficult. The last few labs help you develop the kinks you need to make super awesome projects (xigbee and adc). And in regards to your point of splitting the class into two classes, i disagree. There is already a follow up course 445M. If you were to divide 445L into two courses, you would require 445M to have two prerequisites. Meaning for many students who enter major sequence junior year, it would be difficult to fit in all 3 of the classes which would be valuable for emb sys engineers as its already difficult enough to fit in 445L and 445M while in your 4 years here.", "But if lab 9 and lab 10 are about topics to help you decide which components to put in your device, then why have them after the final project is already set in stone (I understand that it takes time to process these pcbs), would it not be better to have a shortened 1 and 2 lab combined and then show us wireless BEFORE we start designing what we want to build. \n\nI'd love to know if you are in the majority of students that come through the course. I find that if one hasn't had the experience building a robot before this class, the ramp up is quite difficult.", "Personally, I enjoy being challenged in 445L, lab wise. While the whole pre-lab -> lab -> lab report format is time consuming, the pre-lab and lab sessions help me learn a lot (and force me to keep up with everything). The lectures probably need the most restructuring (at least with Bard as a professor). After hearing Bard's lecture for about 4-5 times I realized it wasn't worth my time and I stopped going to class. I also think they should have some of the more intricate labs (like zigbee/adc) before we order PCBs, but that might just be a manufacturing constraint. Good luck, Tyler!", "The main thing that needs work in that class is the lecture. There's a huge variance depending on who you take it with. The other thing is that the lab manual needs a proofreader and some way to make it very very straightforward without telling you exactly what to do.", "Thank you guys so much for your input! I think that Valvano would be proud that so many of us have put so much thought into the class structure! I would be happy to hear anywhere on the lab documents where anyone was confused about what to do as this is the area where I think we can constructively make the biggest difference for future 445L students.", "I think cleaning Valvano's site (and the syllabus) up would make it easier to find requirements, deadlines, and important information. There's a wall of text and a bunch of links. Some of them lead to the same place; It's a mess. Then there's the whole Valvano's site -> Teaching Materials -> Lab Manual on dropbox thing that could be condensed. I shouldn't have to sift to get to the information I need to complete course material; My life is stressful enough as it is.\n\nOrganization is a HUGE issue. Before class even started, Valvano sent everyone an email with some course expectations and requirements. One thing I remember specifically was the LCD requirements. He said we'd need it by Lab 7, but the lab manual (and Bard, TAs, etc) stated lab 2. A lot of us procrastinators had to scramble to get our LCDs.\n\nAlso, the organization makes time management impossible sometimes. I'd LOVE to get labs done early, but things are either not available or get changed, so procrastinating is rewarded by not having to redo a lab. One specific example is Lab 6 (the PCB Artist practice lab). We weren't given the necessary starter file until the morning when part of that lab was due. As much as I appreciate Valvano getting us the correct starter file, it ruined time management as I could have started that lab several days earlier.\n\nThe lab manuals could use some serious proofreading and editing. Sometimes phrases are misleading or incomprehensible, especially for Software students who haven't taken a hardware course beyond EE411. One example is in Lab 9, Approach and Constraints, Item #2. We're given a sampling frequency then the topic goes into the ADC, so we assumed that was a frequency for our ADC. Our TA corrected us (it's a frequency for something else) but that's not very clear in the lab manual.\n\nFinally, this class isn't super friendly to Software students. This course expects you to understand transistor theory (at least at a basic level), and Software students can go through their sequence without ever seeing that material. Lecture doesn't feel useful and the important material for the exams comes from super specific examples that were talked about in passing instead of the overarching topics the lectures (attempt to) cover. As a software major who hasn't spent significant time working in embedded or hardware, I find myself staring blankly at some of the lecture material with a \"WTF?\" going through my mind.\n\nSorry for this, Tyler, but I feel there's just so much that could be discussed to improve this course to make it useful, especially for non-hardware oriented students. Even if the number of labs isn't decreased, there has to be a way improve course consistency and organization to give students time and information they need to have a more reasonable chance of succeeding.", "Trey Franklin that's some incredible commentary thank you so much for taking the time to type out all this consecutive criticism! I have spoken to valvano and he has definitely put serious thought into this class but I think that those of us taking it now can offer so much insight into what is and isn't working! Thanks again man!", "If I may offer my opinion I think that the lectures need to relate more directly with the labs. The slides do help, but the actual lecture with Bard strays from the important topics many times. Also, instead of a pre-lab checkout I would appreciate 30-40 minutes of the TA's giving a clear info session on the specifics of the lab and touching on harder to understand concepts. I have learned a lot in 445L, but at too many times I have felt lost in this class and finding myself unable to understand some of the concepts because of the time constraints with this and all my other classes. It would be nice if nothing was due on the day of the test as well.", "Thanks Eric! This is some great feedback on the prelab formula!", "It seems the main takeaway from all of this is that the lectures need to offer students more relevant content. I think if that was the only change it'd make the course five times as powerful. \n\nThe pipelined prep-procedure-report flow is no fun, but the intention is that all the code is written outside of lab, and lab time is spent debugging and measuring because of the lab equipment. As long as the TAs are fairly lenient with prep the model works, the trick is meeting that pace from the beginning. \n\nAnd yeah, lessening the work due on the test week is important as well. That can all be done without significantly reducing the quality of the material or lessons learned, and it could still be a valuable embedded course.\n\nFWIW, the successive course to 445L, 445M is moving more towards software and RTOS content, so it makes sense to keep 445L focused primarily on HW interfaces, perhaps even dropping the network aspect (which is slated to become a bigger deal in 445M)", "Given that 445M is heading in a direction that will further diminish the 'E' in eCE, and how students suck at basic electrical engineering concept and experience.

The only improvement I would propose is the in-class instruction. lecture should be more less powerpoint and more concept-example.\n\n-Current 445L TA", "I completely agree with Zichong Li, it's very hard to learn labs through powerpoint. The labs aren't so difficult actually. It's really only difficult at times because we receive so few instructions and the lab manuals can be very vague. If the lectures cover more of the labs and lab concepts, it'd be a lot better.", "I agree with zi about reviewing the circuit components in class a bit more in depth because that would be a huge help in the class!

While this is an option, the initiative you take isn't a pro for the class. A class needs to be somewhat challenging to truly offer value. If it's essentially reading a help document, it's not challenging. Every positive comment about the class is regarding going beyond the class to learn more. Once you do that, you're no longer taking part in the class. You're doing something on your own. Any benefit gained from that has nothing to do with the class itself.

There are many more challenging aspects of Java that he could introduce and have us work with. Yes, it's true that using an API is a very important skill to have, but he can show us how to use it and then that's that. I feel like in all his lectures he goes over a new part of the API that he could simply reference and have us look at it ourselves. Then he could spend the lecture time working these Java constructs into larger examples and systems. His lectures are simply talking about the API or basic examples that don't apply to larger projects. Just my opinion. He's obviously very smart, I just don't think he has structured the class well to challenge software developers.", "Saying the course isn't very good isn't a bashing of any professor.
